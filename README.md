# Meta-Ad-Performance-Analysis
This dataset represents Meta Ads Performance Data, covering campaigns, ads, user  demographics, and ad interaction events. It is modelled after how Facebook/Instagram  (Meta) ad platforms capture data.  The purpose of this dataset is to analyse advertising performance, optimize targeting, and  measure ROI (Return on Investment) through KPIs 

**🚀📊 Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing Meta Ad Performance (Facebook & Instagram) to help businesses optimize their marketing spend and improve ROI. Using a dataset of campaigns, ads, and user interactions, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard that tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) and audience insights.

**🛠️ Key Steps & Tech StackData Cleaning (Power Query)**:
Handled missing values and created derived columns like Day_of_Week and Time_of_Day for temporal analysis.DAX Measures: Developed custom measures for business metrics.Data Visualization: Created a multi-page dashboard focusing on Campaign Overview and Audience Segmentation.

**📈 Marketing KPIs (Calculated via DAX)**
I used the following formulas to measure success:
I focused on the most important metrics that drive marketing decisions:
Engagement Metrics: Total Impressions, Clicks, and CTR (Click-Through Rate).
Efficiency Metrics: CPC (Cost Per Click) and CPM (Cost Per Mille).
Conversion Metrics: Total Purchases and Conversion Rate.
ROI Metrics: ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) to measure campaign profitability.
